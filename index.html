        etícia Larcher has had a tough year. As technical coordinator at a conservation institute in western Brazil’s vast Pantanal wetlands, Larcher has spent 2020 dealing with a record spate of wildfires which have destroyed a staggering
        <a id="a" href="http://nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02716-4" target="_blank">22%</a>
        of the Pantanal—an area about 12 times the size of Rhode Island packed with rare wildlife including jaguars and macaws. She’s also watched another devastating fire season tear through

        in a decade.
    </p>
    <p id="p">
        And to cap it all, on Monday, Brazilian environment minister Ricardo Salles added another of the country’s unique landscapes to Larcher’s list of concern. Salles 
        <a id="a" href="https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2020-09-28/ricardo-salles-passa-a-boiada-e-retira-a-protecao-a-manguezais-e-restingas-para-promover-turismo.html" target="_blank">announced an end</a>
        to two legal protections for mangroves and coastal restinga forests, arguing the protections were “excessively restrictive” and “stifled economic development.”

        was filed arguing it violates Brazilians’ constitutional right to an ecologically balanced environment. Still, the move opened a new battle ground in one of the most bitterly-fought wars raging in Brazil under far-right President

        “It’s very frustrating,” Larcher says, noting that she studied mangroves and restinga forests for her doctorate before joining conservation efforts in the Pantanal. Both consist of shrubby, hardy plants that scientists consider vital to protecting land from coastal erosion, sheltering biodiversity and sequestering carbon from the atmosphere to slow the greenhouse effect. ”Salles is the environment minister: his role is to take decisions for the environment, not for other groups.”
    </p>
    <p id="p">
        It’s not exactly unexpected from Salles, who is nicknamed ‘The Terminator’ among Brazilian climate activists. Appointed by

        in December 2018, the 45-year-old has led a decisive campaign to overhaul Brazil’s environmental institutions and relax regulations.

        In May, a video of a ministerial meeting, 
        <a id="a" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/bolsonaro-brazil-cabinet-video-court-judge" target="_blank">published as part of a Supreme Court investigation into Bolsonaro</a>
        , captured Salles telling the president that they should take advantage of the media’s 
        <a id="a" href="https://time.com/5829773/jair-bolsonaro-coronavirus-corruption/">preoccupation with the COVID-19 pandemic</a>
        “to push through and change all the rules and simplify norms.” In July, the federal public prosecutor’s office filed a request to remove Salles from office on the grounds that he is  “violating his duty to protect the environment.” The case has not yet been reviewed and prosecutors re-upped it to a federal court on Monday.
    </p>
    <p id="p">
        Activists say Salles is working to appease certain business sectors that  
        <a id="a" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-45979682" target="_blank">form a crucial part of the president’s support base</a>
        . “He’s doing exactly the job he was put there to do,” says Rômulo Batista, spokesman for Greenpeace Brazil’s Amazon campaign. ”As a result, he’s by far the worst environment minister since Brazil returned to democracy” more than 30 years ago.”

        <strong>In October, a 17-year-old</strong>
        climate activist burst into a public hearing in Brazil’s congress to hand Salles 
        <a id="a" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3ZoQlnhtUC/?utm_source=ig_embed" target="_blank">a trophy</a>
        . It read ‘
        <i>O Exterminador do Futuro’</i>
        —the Brazilian name for 1984 post-apocalyptic film
        <i> The Terminator.</i>
        Others have used that name to refer to Salles’ work as a minister before, including former environment minister Marina Silva, when 
        <a id="a" href="https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2019/05/08/politica/1557338026_221578.html" target="_blank"> she and seven other former environment ministers</a>
        —who had served in Brazilian governments across the political spectrum—warned of the speed with which Bolsonaro and Salles are undoing their work.
    </p>
    <p id="p">
        Before his appointment to the federal government, Salles served as the head of  the São Paulo State Environment Department, where he was 
        <a id="a" href="https://g1.globo.com/sp/sao-paulo/noticia/2018/12/19/justica-de-sp-condena-futuro-ministro-do-meio-ambiente-por-improbidade-administrativa.ghtml" target="_blank">convicted by a state court</a>
        for “administrative dishonesty”, in part over his role in altering maps in a state environmental plan to benefit mining companies. At the time he said he was planning to appeal the decision.
